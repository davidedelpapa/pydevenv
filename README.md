# Pydevenv

Basic environment for small scripts/medium sized projects in Python.

## Usage

Run the `app.py` with

```sh
run app.py
```

You can install packages in the virtual environment adding them to `requirements.txt`.

Deleting the `venv/` folder deletes also the downloaded packages.

Feel free to customize at will.
